# HR Analytics

## Project Overview

This is a public dataset on Kaggle Platform. A large company X has around 4000 employees at any given point of time. However, around 15% of its employee choose to leave and company have to find people to repalce with them from its talent pool. The management wish to improve attrition (retain employee) for the various reason:
*  project may get delayed so that timeline is not meet
*  a sizeable department needs to be maintained 
*  new employees needs training and time.

Thus, 1 HR team was contracted by firm to understand what they shall care more to retain employees. In other words, what could they have done to get most employees stayed. 

To solve such a problem, I have completed few analysis on its dataset to provide my insights.
